**Finding a target 0.3**

You will want to find a girl that doesn't belong to a larger friend group. The more friends she has the more riskier it gets (especially for repeat offenders). I am able to overcome this using my classified stealth tactics. You'd be surprised at how many girls I'm fooling with in a server that you might even know.

Wtf i disconnected...stupid site. So don't think for a second that the innocent and maybe even **taken** egirl is safe. Anyways,you typically want a egirl within a 3 year age span for ughh "reputation" reasons escpecially if you plan on making your erelationship public. Unless of course, you wanna take the freak route. Now there are different types of targets so before covering the lenghty discord method I will start off with the safer Twitter method


**Twitter method 0.4**

Twitter's search button is probably the most goated thing ever
Utilize specific hashtags and keywords to find your targets. I'll list a few
_MAKE SURE YOU ALWAYS CLICK THE_ **_LATEST_** _TAB!!!_

**#mnsfw** (if you know what nsfw means then you can guess what the m is)
other secret keywords: **_maptwt aamtwt cartotwt_** [https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/957090506616221789/957090517278130236/unknown.png?width=479&height=619](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/957090506616221789/957090517278130236/unknown.png?width=479&height=619)

#**shtwt** (sh = self harm) -
