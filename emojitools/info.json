Use `;help emojitools` for more info. **Important**: The `;emojitools save` command group will allow admins across all servers to save emojis to folders in the cog data path, any of which they can upload to Discord as a `.zip` archive. For large and/or public bots, it is highly recommended to restrict usage of or disable the `;emojitools save` command group. The other cog features do **not** require permanent storage, but may be slightly resource-intensive.",
